### Description

This project is part of our data visualisation course at the DO Polytech departement of montpellier. The goal here was to find a dataset and ask ourselves 3 questions about it. Then we had to create a shiny app and a markdown document to visualize the data and answer our questions.

### Shiny app

You will be able to find my shiny app [here](https://thomas-mauran.shinyapps.io/Exoplanets-R-visualization/). letting you play with the data and the visualizations.

### Report

My report is available [here](https://github.com/thomas-mauran/Exoplanets-R-visualization/blob/main/www/exoplanets-markdown.pdf) or directly on the shiny app.
